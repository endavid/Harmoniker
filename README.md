Harmoniker
============

Tool to computer Spherical Harmonics out from pictures.

Installation
-------------
* Use the latest Xcode to compile it.
* It requires Mac OS X 10.6 at least.

Usage
-----
* Work in progress. Right now, you can:
 * Drag 2 images. The one on the left will be considered the front hemisphere, with a simple spherical mapping, and the one to the right, the back hemisphere.
 * Select how many bands of spherical harmonics you want to compute in Settings.
 * Press Compute to generate the Spherical Harmonics. The output right now only appear on the console! The first band's color is also shown.


To do
-----
* Preview the irradiance map (right now, it shows the coordinates of the spherical mapping, which can be saved with "Save Preview" button)
* Show the coefficients of the spherical harmonics on the list view
* Save project
* Allow different mappings (cube map, etc)
